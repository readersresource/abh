# abh

Apocryphorum Bibliae Hebraicae - a JSON-formatted bibliography of apocryphal and pseudepigraphal works of the Second Temple Period relevant to Judaism and Christianity.

# What is abh?

ABH builds upon it's core resource, *Haelewyck, J. (1998). Clavis apocryphorum Veteris Testamenti. Belgium: Brepols*, to catalog and digitize ancient texts relevant to the cultural world of nascent Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. Like the Clavis, the collection is usually limited to apocryphal and pseudepigraphical works inspired by the Hebrew Bible, but occasionally contains other material deemed relevant (e.g. *The Syballine Oracles*)

# How are the JSON objects organized?

An ancient work may exist in more than one language (e.g. Aramaic and Greek). Within a language, the work may have multiple recensions, and each recension may have modern translations available in any number of other languages (e.g. English and German). To allow for the inclusion of as much information about each work as possible, we use the following JSON layout:
